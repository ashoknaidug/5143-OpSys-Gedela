CPU scheduling is a process which allows one process to use the CPU while the execution of another process is on hold(in waiting state) due to unavailability of any resource like I/O etc, thereby making full use of CPU. The aim of CPU scheduling is to make the system efficient, fast and fair.

### Code that is attributed by each team member.
Integrated all different snippets from team members.

- Akkaraboina, Manju Yadav
  - Implemented Semaphores to facilitate and restrict access to shared resources.
  - Implemented Queues for Semaphores and functions.
  - Implemented I/O wait Queue.
  - Integrated all different snippets from team members to make code work as required.
  - Verified to match required outputs for C file. 
- Ashoknaidu Gedela
  - Implemented all the concepts for process.
  - Implemented Job Scheduling Queue and Ready Queue.
  - Implemented Memory Queue for size of memory of each Process.
  - Integrated all different snippets from team members to make code work as required.
  - Verified to match required Outputs for A file.
- Biradhavolu, Sai Avinash Reddy
  - Implemented I/O Process to work as required (RUNNING, READY, or BLOCKED..etc).
  - Implemented I/O Status Queue and shared I/O wait Queue
  - Integrated all different snippets from team members to make code work as required.
  - Verified to match required output for B file.

### Time each team member spent working on project.

Soon after completion of presentations, every team member put together their efforts to complete project on time.It almost took 10 days together to integrate all snippets and to make sure it works as desired.
